# Quiz with React + TypeScript + Vite

This is an individual front end assignment where I was to create a basic quiz and fetching the data from a local json-file. The quiz is responsive and I used a mobile first thinking when creating this. No special requirements for the styling and I was free to use any libraries or styling frameworks. The quiz had to show the correct answer after every question, have a timer and show the result/score after the last questions. I also used local storage to be able to save the players in a highscore list. If i was to have more time with this project I would have used a database with the players instead of storing it in LS, and create a basic API that handles the changes the players make.

You can try out the quiz here: [Quiz](https://smartare-an-en-ph-deltagare.netlify.app/)

## Get started

In the root of the project, open the terminal and write this to install all dependancies:

```
npm install
```

To run the project, write:

```
npm run dev
```

## Tech stack and tools

The tech stack I use is TypeScript along with ReactJs. For styling I use a combination of Sass, Styled components and some components from MUI.

### What would I do different?

If I had more time with this project I would have used a database with the players instead of storing it in LS, and create a basic API with endpoints that handles the changes the players make such as "CreateNewPlayer", "CreateAndAddAnswer" and so on.

My styling would look a lot different if I would remake the quiz with a lot more preparation. I would create a moodboard, prepare more advanced wireframes in Figma and use a sprintboard for the planning throughout the project.
